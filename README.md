PS: you can edit the IP address in the source code to start your own demo.

### Server Folder

The python scripts running in the server are contained in this folder. You can implement the scripts to a cloud server.

**Mongodb is required**

### Data Folder

This folder contains collected data in our experiment. Some data-processing python scripts are also provided.
